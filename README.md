# OopsAllArmor
A fabric mod for 1.18.1 that adds a selection of new armor sets. I've tried make each armor set do something unique such that they all fill some niche not filled by the others. Tested for multiplayer and against the All of Fabric 4 modpack.

* TNT Armor
* Glowstone Armor
* Bow Armor
* Lapis Armor
* Paper Armor
* Enchanting Table Armor
* and many, many more!

Dependencies:
* Fabric API
