# OopsAllArmor
A fabric mod for 1.17.1 that adds a selection of new armor sets. I've tried make each armor set do something unique such that they all fill some niche not filled by the others. It should work in multiplayer, but I haven't actually tested it so use at your own peril.

Armor sets in the mod:
* TNT Armor
* Glowstone Armor
* Bow Armor
* Lapis Armor
* Paper Armor
* Enchanting Table Armor
* and many, many more!

Dependencies:
* Fabric API
